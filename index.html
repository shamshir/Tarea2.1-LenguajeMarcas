		<p>The story and structure are similar to <i>Metroid II</i>, but the game adds new controls, visuals and gameplay. In that sense, this new game could be considered as a reimagining of the original game, as oposed to a simple remake with just graphical updates.</p>
		<p>The images below show a graphical comparison between both versions. The images on the left show a screenshot of the original game, while the images on the right depict how the same areas have been reworked in the remake.</p>
